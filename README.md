# API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp
![My preview](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gRYK5v8f7t7oK0eKQGb3EgtL8ndB_QIIRbJSmN9EHsruayP5DLvchxEtxpvEEGsQRvmG1OixIqtR-reIpnmkhJ5uFX2FfbxrVwF0D3s6k5Ad1Ebz8wj_CakofXFH-1iQm0x7r4unzw=w2400)

You can find my solution of the project here: https://file-metadata-ms-fcc.glitch.me

###    User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
